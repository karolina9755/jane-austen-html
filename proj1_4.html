                    It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of
                    a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
                    first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
                    of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
                    of some one or other of their daughters.

                    &ldquo;My dear Mr. Bennet,&rdquo; said his lady to him one day, &ldquo;have you heard that
                    Netherfield Park is let at last?&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;But it is,&rdquo; returned she; &ldquo;for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told
                    me all about it.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    Mr. Bennet made no answer.

                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Do you not want to know who has taken it?&rdquo; cried his wife impatiently.

                    &ldquo;<i>You</i> want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.&rdquo;

                <p class="book">
                    This was invitation enough.
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by
                    a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down
                    on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted
                    with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take
                    possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the
                    house by the end of next week.&rdquo;

                    &ldquo;Is he married or single?&rdquo;

                    &ldquo;Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
                    five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!&rdquo;

                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;How so? How can it affect them?&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;My dear Mr. Bennet,&rdquo; replied his wife, &ldquo;how can you be so tiresome! You
                    must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Is that his design in settling here?&rdquo;

                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he <i>may</i>
                    fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as
                    he comes.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
                    them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as
                    handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;My dear, you flatter me. I certainly <i>have</i> had my share of beauty,
                    but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has
                    five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
                    beauty.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
                    the neighbourhood.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;It is more than I engage for, I assure you.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be
                    for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely
                    on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed
                    you must go, for it will be impossible for <i>us</i> to visit him if you
                    do not.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad
                    to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty
                    consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must
                    throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
                    others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
                    good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving <i>her</i> the
                    preference.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;They have none of them much to recommend them,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;they are all
                    silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
                    quickness than her sisters.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Mr. Bennet, how <i>can</i> you abuse your own children in such a way? You
                    take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are
                    my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these
                    last twenty years at least.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Ah, you do not know what I suffer.&rdquo;

                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
                    thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
                    visit them.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
                    all.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve,
                    and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been
                    insufficient to make his wife understand his character. <i>Her</i> mind
                    was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
                    little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she
                    fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters
                    married; its solace was visiting and news.

                </h2>
                <p class="book">
                    Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
                    had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
                    wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid
                    she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner.
                    Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly
                    addressed her with:
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;We are not in a way to know <i>what</i> Mr. Bingley likes,&rdquo; said her
                    mother resentfully, &ldquo;since we are not to visit.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;But you forget, mamma,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;that we shall meet him at the
                    assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of
                    her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of
                    her.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;No more have I,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet; &ldquo;and I am glad to find that you do not
                    depend on her serving you.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself,
                    began scolding one of her daughters.
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake! Have a little
                    compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,&rdquo; said her father; &ldquo;she times them
                    ill.&rdquo;

                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;I do not cough for my own amusement,&rdquo; replied Kitty fretfully. &ldquo;When is
                    your next ball to be, Lizzy?&rdquo;

                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;To-morrow fortnight.&rdquo;

                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Aye, so it is,&rdquo; cried her mother, &ldquo;and Mrs. Long does not come back till
                    the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she
                    will not know him herself.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
                    Mr. Bingley to <i>her</i>.&rdquo;

                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
                    myself; how can you be so teasing?&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;I honour your circumspection. A fortnight&rsquo;s acquaintance is certainly
                    very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
                    fortnight. But if <i>we</i> do not venture somebody else will; and after
                    all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,
                    as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
                    take it on myself.&rdquo;

                    The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, &ldquo;Nonsense,
                    nonsense!&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Do you
                    consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them,
                    as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you <i>there</i>. What say you,
                    Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great
                    books and make extracts.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.

                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;While Mary is adjusting her ideas,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;let us return to Mr.
                    Bingley.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;I am sick of Mr. Bingley,&rdquo; cried his wife.
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;I am sorry to hear <i>that</i>; but why did not you tell me that before?
                    If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on
                    him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot
                    escape the acquaintance now.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
                    Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy
                    was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
                    while.
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade
                    you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an
                    acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too,
                    that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till
                    now.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet; and,
                    as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;What an excellent father you have, girls!&rdquo; said she, when the door was
                    shut. &ldquo;I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
                    or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so pleasant,
                    I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your
                    sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you <i>are</i> the
                    youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Lydia stoutly, &ldquo;I am not afraid; for though I <i>am</i> the
                    youngest, I&rsquo;m the tallest.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return
                    Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.

                <p class="book">
                    Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
                    daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
                    husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in
                    various ways&mdash;with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
                    distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at
                    last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
                    Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
                    delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
                    agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
                    with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
                    dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes
                    of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s heart were entertained.
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,&rdquo;
                    said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, &ldquo;and all the others equally well married,
                    I shall have nothing to wish for.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s visit, and sat about ten
                    minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
                    admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
                    much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate,
                    for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he
                    wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had
                    Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
                    housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
                    was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to
                    accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
                    disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so
                    soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he
                    might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled
                    at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by
                    starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party
                    for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring
                    twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls
                    grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before
                    the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him
                    from London&mdash;his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party
                    entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether&mdash;Mr.
                    Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young
                    man.
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
                    countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
                    with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
                    looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of
                    the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the
                    report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his
                    entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him
                    to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer
                    than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about
                    half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of
                    his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his
                    company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in
                    Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable
                    countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people
                    in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry
                    that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at
                    Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a
                    contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.
                    Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other
                    lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room,
                    speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided.
                    He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody
                    hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent
                    against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was
                    sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her
                    daughters.
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
                    down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
                    standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.
                    Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to
                    join it.
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Come, Darcy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing
                    about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly
                    acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be
                    insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in
                    the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;I would not be so fastidious as you are,&rdquo; cried Mr. Bingley, &ldquo;for a
                    kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
                    life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
                    uncommonly pretty.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;<i>You</i> are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,&rdquo; said Mr.
                    Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of
                    her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare
                    say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Which do you mean?&rdquo; and turning round he looked for a moment at
                    Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:
                    &ldquo;She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt <i>me</i>; I am in no
                    humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by
                    other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for
                    you are wasting your time with me.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
                    remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,
                    however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
                    playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
                    Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.
                    Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by
                    his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be,
                    though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane&rsquo;s pleasure. Mary had heard
                    herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the
                    neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to
                    be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at
                    a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the
                    village where they lived, and of which they were the principal
                    inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless
                    of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to
                    the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He
                    had rather hoped that his wife&rsquo;s views on the stranger would be
                    disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,&rdquo; as she entered the room, &ldquo;we have had a most
                    delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane
                    was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she
                    looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her
                    twice! Only think of <i>that</i>, my dear; he actually danced with her
                    twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
                    time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
                    up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
                    can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down
                    the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her
                    for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two
                    fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two
                    sixth with Lizzy, and the <i>Boulanger</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;If he had had any compassion for <i>me</i>,&rdquo; cried her husband
                    impatiently, &ldquo;he would not have danced half so much! For God&rsquo;s sake, say
                    no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first
                    dance!&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively
                    handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw
                    anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.
                    Hurst&rsquo;s gown&mdash;&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
                    description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of
                    the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
                    exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.
                </p>
                <p class="book">
                    &ldquo;But I can assure you,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that Lizzy does not lose much by not
                    suiting <i>his</i> fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not
                    at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
                    him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!
                    Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to
